        <h3>1. What did I do since last meeting?</h3>
        <p> I tried to do the "Add customizable alert to index.html", but I wasn't able to go over point 
            #2 because I still don't understand what is the purpose of it. I wish I could see what it is suppose to do 
            to be able to complete it. I also assigned another task which is to "add discount to product detail pages.
        </p>
        <h3> What am I going to do next? </h3>
        <p>
            Finish "Add customizable alert to index.html"
        </p>
        <h3> 3. What are my blockers?</h3>
        <p> Language barrier, I read what I'm suppose to do but I can't understand it all!</p>
